class Root(ABCUIElement):
    '''
    :parameter element: The element that will be drawn when the root is
        drawn. (Optional, can be reassigned at any time.)
    :parameter terminal: An instance of a :class:`Terminal` object to use
        for communication with your TTY. (Optional, we will grab a default
        and can be reassigned so long as we're not currently running.)
    :parameter loop: The asyncio event loop to use for the main :meth:`run`
        method. (Optional, we will grab a default if none is provided, and
        the loop can be reassigned so long as we're not currently running.)

    A :class:`Root` object will normally form the nucleus of your application.
    It performs three key roles:

    * Managing running the default :class:`Terminal` and the :mod:`asyncio`
      event loop
    * Providing easy access to add formats and styles to your applications
      content via :attr:`format` and :attr:`style`
    * Acting as the base of a tree of UI elements (instances of
      :class:`ABCUIElement`)

    A simple example of all three of these roles can be found in
    ``examples/quick_brown_fox.py``:

        required.

        Specifically, :mod:`jcn` applications run the terminal full-screen and
        with the cursor hidden, and set :attr:`sys.stdin` to unbuffered and
        non-blocking so that we can respond immediately to any keystrokes from
        the user. We also correctly handle being suspended (``ctrl+z``,
        SIGTSTP) and resumed, and the terminal window being resized.

        We run :mod:`asyncio` event loop inside context managers that will
        handle exceptions gracefully and return the terminal to the previous
        state before exiting. Aren't we nice ;-)
